## About the LAB-GNSS

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td width="450">The GPS/GNSS laboratory is part of the Department of Telecommunications at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (<a href="https://www.ita.br">Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica, ITA</a> ), located in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brazil.  <br> <br> 
    Prof. <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6596-0123">Felix Antreich</a>  is the head of the GPS/GNSS laboratory. From 2003 till 2018 he was an Associate Researcher with the Department of Navigation, Institute of Communications and Navigation of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany. From 2016 to 2018 he was a Visiting Professor in the Department of Teleinformatics Engineering (DETI) at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC) in Fortaleza, Brazil. Since July 2018 he is a Professor with the Department of Telecommunications in the Division of Electronics Engineering of ITA in São José dos Campos, Brazil.

## What is this organization meant for?

This organization is meant to provide an integrated environment for the laboratory's internal and external researchers to work on joint projects, share knowledge, and collaborate on research and development activities. For this purpose, this organization contains all the material (organized in repos) of interest for the research group, including papers, reports, code, software, and other relevant documents. 

## How is the content organized?

While some repositories were forked from external sources and maintained as public repositories, most of the content is original and was developed by the research group members (students, professors, and researchers) with possible external collaborators. The project repositories can have finished or work-in-progress status, and be either public or private. When part of a private repository is intented to be shared with the scientific community in general, a mirrored filtered public repository is created for that goal.

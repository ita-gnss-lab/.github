# Aeronautics Institute of Technology's GPS/GNSS Laboratory

## We are we?

The GPS/GNSS laboratory is part of the Department of Telecommunications at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica, ITA), located in São José dos Campos, São Paulo, Brazil. The laboratory is focused on research and development of algorithms and techniques for satellite navigation and communication (NavCom) systems, with a special emphasis on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and their applications.

The laboratory is equipped with state-of-the-art GNSS receivers, antennas, and simulators, which are used for research, development, and testing of GNSS algorithms and techniques.

## What is this organization meant for?

This organization is meant to provide an integrated environment for laboratory's internal and external researchers to work on joint projects, share knowledge, and collaborate on research and development activities. For this purpose, this organization contains all the material (organized in repos) of interest for the research group, including papers, reports, code, software, and other relevant documents. 

## How to content is organized?

While some repositories were forked from external sources, most of the content is original and was developed by the research group members, which includes students, professors, and researchers. Moreover, while some repositories are public and intended for sharing with the scientific community in general, others are private and meant to be developed either internally or with outside collaborators.
